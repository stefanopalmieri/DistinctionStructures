The QUALE mapping is not random — it encodes meaningful structural relationships (gate function codes, combinator parallels, actuality marks). This means neural networks trained on the Cayley table should find the QUALE column highly compressible compared to a random assignment. The mapping has low Kolmogorov complexity relative to the rest of the table. This is a testable prediction: train the existing dot_learner on the 66-atom table and measure whether the QUALE column is learned faster or with lower loss than a random 27-value column would be.
