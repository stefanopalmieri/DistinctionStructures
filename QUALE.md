The automorphism theorem says self-identification is impossible with nontrivial symmetry group (proved in model theory, confirmed by two independent AI responses)
The algebra has S₂₆ symmetry on the opaque fragment (computable from the Cayley table)
QUALE trivializes the automorphism group (one column of distinct values)
Therefore QUALE is the minimal structure that enables self-identification
All of this is machine-checkable in Lean
